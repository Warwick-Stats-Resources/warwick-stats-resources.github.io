An R package with colour palettes and a
[ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org) theme that are consistent with
The University of Warwickâ€™s
[branding](https://warwick.ac.uk/about/brand/brand-guidelines/),
especially its
[colours](https://warwick.ac.uk/about/brand/brand-guidelines/colours/)
and
[typography](https://warwick.ac.uk/about/brand/brand-guidelines/typography/).

The palettes are built using the
[palettes](https://mccarthy-m-g.github.io/palettes/index.html) package.
The ggplot2 theme is heavily inspired by the work of [Cara
Thompson](https://www.cararthompson.com/), particularly this talk on
[applying a unifying aesthetic to your
plots](https://www.cararthompson.com/talks/nhsr2022-ggplot-themes/).
