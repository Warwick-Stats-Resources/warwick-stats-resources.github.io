It assumes that the course/workshop is delivered across several sessions, and that each session will have its own content page and its own set of slides (though can be simplified if only one content page/set of slides is required). The slides for each session are embedded in the content page for the session, and a link is supplied to read the slides in a new window.\nFor full documentation on how to use the template, see the GitHub repo’s README."
